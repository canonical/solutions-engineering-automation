# Contributor Guide

## Contributing Code

### Workflow

1. **Choose/Create an Issue**: Before starting work on an enhancement, create an issue that explains your use case. This helps track progress and keeps the discussion organized. The issue will be tracked on the GitHub issue page.

2. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork of the repository to make your changes.

3. **Create a New Branch**: Make sure to create a new branch for your contribution.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Submit a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch. Reference the issue by adding `#Fixed xxx` (replace `xxx` with the issue number) to automatically link the issue to your PR.

5. **Review Process**: A team member will review your pull request. They may suggest changes or leave comments, so keep an eye on the PR status and be ready to make updates if needed.

6. **Documentation**: Any documentation changes should be included as part of your PR or as a separate PR linked to your original PR.


### Hard Requirements

- **Testing and Code Coverage**: Changes must be accompanied by appropriate unit tests and meet the project's code coverage requirements. Functional and integration tests should be added when applicable to ensure the stability of the codebase.

- **Sign Your Commits**: Be sure to [sign your commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).
